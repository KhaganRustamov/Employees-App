This is my first React.js project. In this project, I implemented dynamic user interaction with the application. The application itself is a list of company employees, on which you can perform various operations, for example, delete employees, add new employees, filter them by salary, select employees for promotion or bonuses, and also filter them according to specified criteria and the user can use search strings to find the employees he needs. This project uses basic React, so there are no advanced approaches to creating an application, but in future projects I will try to use more complex and flexible approaches.
